                    <p>A program is a group of logical, mathematical and sequential functions grouped together. When they are grouped, these functions perform a task. Each programming language focuses on different types of tasks as well as gives commands to the machine in different ways.</p>

<p>
In computer programming, a class contains a group of instructions that act as commands for the computer. The class is made up of variables, integers, decimals and other symbols. These are put together in certain orders to let the computer know what task to perform.

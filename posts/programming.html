                    <p>Computer programming has an integral role in our world. You would not be reading this article without it. In fact, without computer programming you would not be able to use your cell phone, computer or smart TV. Learning the fundamentals of programming can set you apart from your counterparts, giving you a competitive edge in this technology-driven world. Earning a computer programming degree can help you innovate and create solutions for a global society.

                    <h2>What Is Programming?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Programming is using a language that a machine can understand in order to get it to perform various tasks. Computer programming is how we communicate with machines in a way that makes them function how we need.</p>


                   

                    <h2 class="turf">What Is a Program?</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>A program is a group of logical, mathematical and sequential functions grouped together. When they are grouped, these functions perform a task. Each programming language focuses on different types of tasks as well as gives commands to the machine in different ways.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="turf">What Is a Class?</h2>
                    <hr>

<p>
In computer programming, a class contains a group of instructions that act as commands for the computer. The class is made up of variables, integers, decimals and other symbols. These are put together in certain orders to let the computer know what task to perform.

                    <h2 class="turf">Why Is it Important to Know About Computer Programming?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>If you are thinking about earning your computer programming degree, you will need to know about programming languages, classes, functions and commands. You will create applications, software or different programs. In addition, you may create programs that need to work on various operating systems such as iOS or Android. Those programs have different functions and classes, which means they rely on different programming languages.

All applications on the web are created using computer programming. The languages used in each application you have range from similar to vastly different. Additionally, some languages create things that are running in the background, so you do not even know they are there. Learning computer programming languages allows you to be a versatile computer programmer.

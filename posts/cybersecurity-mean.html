                    <p>Every project is completely different and has a unique set of
                        needs hence its great to understand the strengths and opportunities that both have. The aim
                        of this article is to help developers decide for themselves on which one fits their need
                        ü§î</p>

                    <p>First Angular is a framework while React is a library.
                        However, we'll compare the ecosystem not the framework and library themselves.

                    <h3>Angular</h3>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>
                            Big learning curve
                            with lots of fairly new complex vocabulary like dependency injection, directives, decorators
                            and pipes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learning Typescript ,a JS superscript, is recommended.
                        </li>
                        <li>There are a few ways to do something making it easier to implement things since it's fairly
                            more opinionated but
                            less flexible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3 class="pimp">React</h3>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>
                            Less to learn
                            since it's only the core library.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Requires extra packages and modules
                            for functions like routing, validation, HTTP requests
                            which adds to the learning curve.
                        </li>
                        <li>React
                            has many ways of doing the same thing
                            for example handling state and property, making
                            HTTP requests can be handled differently.
                            Advise : Work with best practices.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developer needs to learn about
                            Redux
                            , an application level state manager, which is hard to
                            set up and learn.

                    <h3>Angular</h3>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>Its a
                            full front to back framework
                            which includes routing, form tools, HTTP Library,
                            Reactive extension which bloat the framework making it
                            slower
                            .
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pimp">React</h3>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li> It's
                            much smaller
                            but adding packages makes it slower however it's much
                            faster
                            in general
                            compared to Angular.

                    <h2 class="turf">Features</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>These two have a lot of similar features like,
                        both are component-based and offer dynamic
                        markup

                        . However here are some different features of each.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Angular</h3>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>It's a
                            battery included framework
                            with a component router, RxJS for things like observables,
                            HTTP client & a form module for validation.
                        </li>
                        <li>It
                            offers two way binding
                            i.e binding data from model to view & vice versa.
                        </li>
                        <li>Has support for
                            Model View Controller.

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            External packages makes the library more powerful
                            like React Router, Fetch (a HTTP client) &
                            Enzyme(for testing)

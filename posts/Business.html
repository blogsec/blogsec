                    <h2>College Degree</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>Most businessmen have at least a bachelor's degree in business, marketing, accounting, management or a related field. Those who want to move up the corporate ladder often get a master's degree or MBA – master of business administration – which is often a prerequisite for executive positions. Business or related degrees help students understand how companies structure their organizations, obtain financing and operate in competitive marketplaces. There are also internships and co-op programs for students to acquire practical experience before starting their business careers.</p>

                

                    <h2 class="turf">Being Action-Oriented</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Business managers, particularly entrepreneurs, are action-oriented – they must constantly differentiate themselves and their products from competitors. These professionals must be attuned to what products and technologies consumers demand so they can increase their customer bases and company sales and profits.
<br>
Action gets results in the business world, and the success of top executives and managers is contingent upon results: building revenue, market share and customer satisfaction. Additionally, you must be willing to take risks in those actions, according to the Institute of Entrepreneurship Development.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="turf">Being an Excellent Communicator</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Businessmen must be excellent communicators, according to Street Directory. A businessman communicates with employees at different levels of an organization, including subordinates, managers from other departments and company presidents. They train subordinates how to accurately complete tasks, and they often present important findings and data to company management. These professionals must also know how to interact with suppliers, vendors and clients. Sales reps, for example, use persuasive communication to convince people to buy their products or services.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="turf">Problem Solving</h2>
                    <hr>

<p>Another common pick of entrepreneur tips to being a businessman is problem-solving skills. The business environment never remains stagnant. Laws, regulations and the state of the economy are constantly changing. A new labeling law, for example, may force a product manager to include more specific nutritional information on product packages. He'll need to determine how to factor in additional costs while operating within budget parameters. Aggressive advertising from a competitor might force him to create new advertising messages. Businessmen continually face new problems as they solve existing ones.</p>

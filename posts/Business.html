                    <p>Businessmen and businesswomen work can work in nearly any field. Some run their own companies, creating products and services that meet the needs of consumers. They all work on various projects and must be punctilious in meeting deadlines. An individual's skills, motivation and aspirations are important, and there are several key traits and accomplishments that are necessary for success as a businessman.

                    <h2>College Degree</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>Most businessmen have at least a bachelor's degree in business, marketing, accounting, management or a related field. Those who want to move up the corporate ladder often get a master's degree or MBA – master of business administration – which is often a prerequisite for executive positions. Business or related degrees help students understand how companies structure their organizations, obtain financing and operate in competitive marketplaces. There are also internships and co-op programs for students to acquire practical experience before starting their business careers.</p>

                

                    <h2 class="turf">Being Action-Oriented</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Business managers, particularly entrepreneurs, are action-oriented – they must constantly differentiate themselves and their products from competitors. These professionals must be attuned to what products and technologies consumers demand so they can increase their customer bases and company sales and profits.
<br>
Action gets results in the business world, and the success of top executives and managers is contingent upon results: building revenue, market share and customer satisfaction. Additionally, you must be willing to take risks in those actions, according to the Institute of Entrepreneurship Development.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="turf">Being an Excellent Communicator</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Businessmen must be excellent communicators, according to Street Directory. A businessman communicates with employees at different levels of an organization, including subordinates, managers from other departments and company presidents. They train subordinates how to accurately complete tasks, and they often present important findings and data to company management. These professionals must also know how to interact with suppliers, vendors and clients. Sales reps, for example, use persuasive communication to convince people to buy their products or services.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="turf">End-user protection</h2>
                    <hr>

<p>
 End-user protection or endpoint security is a crucial aspect of cyber security. After all, it is often an individual (the end-user) who accidentally uploads malware or another form of cyber threat to their desktop, laptop or mobile device.
<br>
So, how do cyber-security measures protect end users and systems? First, cyber-security relies on cryptographic protocols to encrypt emails, files, and other critical data. This not only protects information in transit, but also guards against loss or theft.
<br>
In addition, end-user security software scans computers for pieces of malicious code, quarantines this code, and then removes it from the machine. Security programs can even detect and remove malicious code hidden in primary boot record and are designed to encrypt or wipe data from computer’s hard drive.
<br>
Electronic security protocols also focus on real-time malware detection. Many use heuristic and behavioral analysis to monitor the behavior of a program and its code to defend against viruses or Trojans that change their shape with each execution (polymorphic and metamorphic malware). Security programs can confine potentially malicious programs to a virtual bubble separate from a user's network to analyze their behavior and learn how to better detect new infections.
